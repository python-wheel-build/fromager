# Customizing parts of the package build process

Fromager support customizing most aspects of the build process,
including acquiring the source, applying local patches, passing
arguments to the build, and providing a custom build command.

## Variants

It is frequently necessary to build the same packages in different
ways, especially for binary wheels with code compiled for different
operating systems or hardware architectures. In fromager, the sets of
build configuration options for each scenario is called a "variant".

The default variant is `cpu`, to differentiate from variants for
hardware accelerators.

A variant name can be any string, but since the variant name shows up
in filesystem paths it is often easier to avoid including whitespace.

Set the variant using the `--variant` command line option or the
`FROMAGER_VARIANT` environment variable (for ease of use in
containers).

## Build environment variables

Most python packages with configurable builds use environment
variables to pass build parameters. The `--envs-dir` command line
argument specifies a directory with environment files for passing
variables to the builds. The default is `overrides/envs`.

The most common reason for passing different environment variables is
to support different build variants, such as to enable different
hardware accelerators. Therefore, the environment file directory is
organized with a subdirectory per variant.

Environment files are named using the [canonical distribution
name](#canonical-distribution-names) and the suffix `.env`.

```
$ tree overrides/envs/
overrides/envs/
├── cpu
│   └── vllm.env
├── cuda
│   ├── flash_attn.env
│   └── llama_cpp_python.env
└── test
    └── testenv.env
```

Environment files use shell-like syntax to set variables, with the
variable name followed by `=` and then the variable value. Whitespace
around the 3 parts will be ignored, but whitespace inside the value is
preserved. It is not necessary to quote values, and quotes inside the
value will be passed through.

```
$ cat overrides/envs/cuda/llama_cpp_python.env
CMAKE_ARGS=-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=all-major -DLLAMA_NATIVE=off
CFLAGS=-mno-avx
FORCE_CMAKE=1
```

## Patching source

The `--patches-dir` command line argument specifies a directory
containing patches to be applied after the source code is in place and
before evaluating any further dependencies or building the
project. The default directory is `overrides/patches`.

Patch files should be prefixed with the [canonical distribution
name](#canonical-distribution-names) followed by a hyphen (`-`) and
the version number of the package and use the suffix `.patch`. The
filenames are sorted lexicographically, so any text between the prefix
and suffix can be used to ensure the patches are applied in a specific
order.

Patches are applied by running `patch -p1 filename` while inside the
root of the source tree.

```
$ ls -1 overrides/patches/
clarifai-10.2.1-fix-sdist.patch
flash_attn-2.5.7-pyproject-toml.patch
jupyterlab_pygments-0.3.0-pyproject-remove-jupyterlab.patch
ninja-1.11.1.1-wrap-system-ninja.patch
pytorch-v2.2.1-001-remove-cmake-build-requirement.patch
pytorch-v2.2.1-002-dist-info-no-run-build-deps.patch
pytorch-v2.2.1-003-fbgemm-no-maybe-uninitialized.patch
pytorch-v2.2.1-004-fix-release-version.patch
pytorch-v2.2.2-001-remove-cmake-build-requirement.patch
pytorch-v2.2.2-002-dist-info-no-run-build-deps.patch
pytorch-v2.2.2-003-fbgemm-no-maybe-uninitialized.patch
pytorch-v2.2.2-004-fix-release-version.patch
xformers-0.0.26.post1-pyproject.toml.patch
```

## Override plugins

For more complex customization requirements, create an override plugin.

Plugins are registered using [entry
points](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/entry-points/)
so they can be discovered and loaded at runtime. In `pyproject.toml`,
configure the entry point in the
`project.entry-points."fromager.project_overrides"` namespace to
link the [canonical distribution name](#canonical-distribution-names)
to an importable module.

```
[project.entry-points."fromager.project_overrides"]
flit_core = "package_plugins.flit_core"
pyarrow = "package_plugins.pyarrow"
torch = "package_plugins.torch"
triton = "package_plugins.triton"
```

The plugins are treated as providing overriding implementations of
functions with default implementations, so it is only necessary to
implement the functions needed to make it possible to build the
package.

### download_source

The `download_source()` function is responsible for resolving a
requirement and acquiring the source for that version of a
package. The default is to use pypi.org to resolve the requirement and
then download the sdist file for the package.

The arguments are the `WorkContext`, the `Requirement` being
evaluated, and the URL to the server where sdists may be found.

The return value should be a tuple containing the location where the
source archive file was written and the version that was resolved.

The function may be invoked more than once if multiple sdist servers
are being used. Returning a valid response prevents multiple
invocations.

```
def download_source(ctx, req, sdist_server_url):
    ...
    return source_filename, version
```

### prepare_source

The `prepare_source()` function is responsible for setting up a tree
of source files in a format that is ready to be built. The default
implementation unpacks the source archive and applies patches.

The arguments are the `WorkContext`, the `Requirement` being
evaluated, the `Path` to the source archive, and the version.

The return value should be the `Path` to the root of the source tree,
ideally inside the `ctx.work_dir` directory.

```
def prepare_source(ctx, req, source_filename, version):
    ...
    return output_dir_name
```

### expected_source_archive_name

The `expected_source_archive_name()` function is used to re-discover a
source archive downloaded by a previous step, especially if the
filename does not match the standard naming scheme for an sdist.

The arguments are the `Requirement` being evaluated and the version to
look for.

The return value should be a string with the base filename (no paths)
for the archive.

```
def expected_source_archive_name(req, dist_version):
    return f'apache-arrow-{dist_version}.tar.gz'
```

### expected_source_directory_name

The `expected_source_directory_name()` function is used to re-discover
the location of a source tree prepared by a previous step, especially
if the name does not match the standard naming scheme for an sdist.

The arguments are the `Requirement` being evaluated and the version to
look for.

The return value should be a string with the name of the source root
directory relative to the `ctx.work_dir` where it was prepared.

```
def expected_source_directory_name(req, dist_version):
    return f'apache-arrow-{dist_version}/arrow-apache-arrow-{dist_version}'
```

### get_build_system_dependencies

The `get_build_system_dependencies()` function should return the PEP
517 build dependencies for a package.

The arguments are the `WorkContext`, the `Requirement` being
evaluated, and the `Path` to the root of the source tree.

The return value is an iterable of requirement specification strings
for build system dependencies for the package. The caller is
responsible for evaluating the requirements with the current build
environment settings to determine if they are actually needed.

```
# pyarrow.py
def get_build_system_dependencies(ctx, req, sdist_root_dir):
    # The _actual_ directory with our requirements is different than
    # the source root directory detected for the build because the
    # source tree doesn't just include the python package.
    return dependencies.default_get_build_system_dependencies(
        ctx, req,
        sdist_root_dir / 'python',
    )
```

### get_build_backend_dependencies

The `get_build_backend_dependencies()` function should return the PEP
517 build dependencies for a package.

The arguments are the `WorkContext`, the `Requirement` being
evaluated, and the `Path` to the root of the source tree.

The return value is an iterable of requirement specification strings
for build backend dependencies for the package. The caller is
responsible for evaluating the requirements with the current build
environment settings to determine if they are actually needed.

```
# pyarrow.py
def get_build_backend_dependencies(ctx, req, sdist_root_dir):
    # The _actual_ directory with our requirements is different than
    # the source root directory detected for the build because the
    # source tree doesn't just include the python package.
    return dependencies.default_get_build_backend_dependencies(
        ctx, req,
        sdist_root_dir / 'python',
    )
```

### get_install_dependencies

The `get_install_dependencies()` function should return the PEP 517
installation and runtime dependencies for a package.

The arguments are the `WorkContext`, the `Requirement` being
evaluated, and the `Path` to the root of the source tree.

The return value is an iterable of requirement specification strings
for runtime and installation dependencies for the package. The caller
is responsible for evaluating the requirements with the current build
environment settings to determine if they are actually needed.

```
# pyarrow.py
def get_install_dependencies(ctx, req, sdist_root_dir):
    # The _actual_ directory with our requirements is different than
    # the source root directory detected for the build because the
    # source tree doesn't just include the python package.
    return dependencies.default_get_install_dependencies(
        ctx, req,
        sdist_root_dir / 'python',
    )
```

### build_wheel

The `build_wheel()` function is responsible for creating a wheel from
the prepared source tree and placing it in `ctx.wheels_build`.. The
default implementation invokes `pip wheel` in a temporary directory
and passes the path to the source tree as argument.

The arguments are the `WorkContext`, the `Path` to a virtualenv
prepared with the build dependencies, a `dict` with extra environment
variables to pass to the build, the `Requirement` being evaluated, and
the `Path` to the root of the source tree.

The return value is ignored.

```
def build_wheel(ctx, build_env, extra_environ, req, sdist_root_dir):
    ...
```

## Canonical distribution names

The Python packaging ecosystem is flexible in how the source
distribution, wheel, and python package names are represented in
filenames and requirements specifications. To standardize and ensure
that build customizations are recognized correctly, we always use a
canonical version of the name, computed using
`packaging.utils.canonicalize_name()`. For convenience, the
`canonicalize` command will print the correct form of a name.

```
$ tox -e cli -- canonicalize flit-core
flit_core
```
